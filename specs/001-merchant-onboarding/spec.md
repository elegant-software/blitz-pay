# Feature Specification: Merchant Onboarding

**Feature Branch**: `[001-merchant-onboarding]`  
**Created**: 2026-03-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "merchant-onboarding"

## Clarifications

### Session 2026-03-23

- Q: Should this feature scope end at approval, include activation, or also include ongoing monitoring? → A: Scope includes activation and ongoing monitoring.
- Q: Should EU AML/KYB and GDPR obligations be explicit requirements in this feature? → A: EU AML/KYB and GDPR obligations are explicit requirements in this feature.

### Session 2026-04-19 (product catalog)

- Q: Where should product images be stored? → A: Object storage (S3-compatible); product record holds only the image URL. (FR-032 added)
- Q: Should products support a deactivated/archived state, or is simple create/update/delete sufficient? → A: Soft delete — products have an `active` flag; inactive products are hidden from buyers but retained. (FR-033 added)
- Q: Who can create and manage products for a merchant? → A: Both — merchants manage their own catalog via self-service API; internal admins can override. (FR-029, FR-030 added)
- Q: Is product unit price always in the merchant's registered currency, or can each product carry its own currency? → A: Product price inherits the merchant's registered currency — no per-product currency field. (FR-031 updated)
- Q: Should zero-price products be allowed, and how is unit price expressed? → A: Zero-price allowed — free/sample products are a valid use case; unit price is decimal ≥ 0. (FR-034 added)
- Q: Multi-tenancy practices must be followed for product tables — how should tenant isolation be enforced? → A: Both — application-level filtering (`merchant_id` scoping) as primary path; PostgreSQL Row Level Security as safety net. (FR-035, FR-036 added)

### Session 2026-04-19 (merchant location)

- Q: Are latitude and longitude required fields during merchant registration? → A: Optional — coordinates and Place ID can be provided or enriched after registration. (FR-037 added)
- Q: Where should latitude, longitude, and Google Place ID be stored? → A: Separate `MerchantLocation` entity — new table with FK to `merchant_applications`. (FR-038 added)
- Q: Should location be updatable after initial registration? → A: Yes, via a dedicated `PUT /v1/merchants/{id}/location` endpoint. (FR-039 added)
- Q: Should Google Maps Place ID be validated against Maps API on save? → A: Store as-is without external validation; a future background job may validate/enrich it. Checklist item added. (FR-040 added)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Submit Merchant Application (Priority: P1)

A prospective merchant can start onboarding, provide required business, ownership, and contact details, review their information, and submit an application that satisfies EU compliance intake requirements to join BlitzPay.

**Why this priority**: Without a complete application flow, merchants cannot begin the onboarding journey and the business cannot acquire new merchants.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a new merchant application from start to submission and verifying that the application is stored with a submitted status and confirmation is shown to the applicant.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a prospective merchant has not started onboarding, **When** they enter all required business and primary contact information and submit the application, **Then** the system records the application and confirms successful submission.
2. **Given** a prospective merchant leaves required fields incomplete or enters invalid values, **When** they attempt to continue or submit, **Then** the system highlights the issues and prevents submission until they are corrected.
3. **Given** a prospective merchant has entered onboarding information, **When** they review the application before submitting, **Then** they can verify and correct the details before final submission.
4. **Given** compliance-related information or supporting materials are required, **When** the merchant attempts to submit without them, **Then** the system prevents submission and identifies what is still required.

---

### User Story 2 - Track Onboarding Status (Priority: P2)

A merchant who has submitted an application can view the current onboarding status, understand whether action is required, and see the next step needed to become active.

**Why this priority**: Status visibility reduces uncertainty, lowers support burden, and keeps merchants moving through the onboarding funnel.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting an application, moving it through multiple status states, and verifying the merchant sees the latest status, outstanding actions, and final outcome.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a merchant has submitted an application, **When** they return to the onboarding experience, **Then** they can see the current status of their application.
2. **Given** additional information is required from the merchant, **When** the application status changes to action required, **Then** the merchant sees what is missing and can resubmit the requested information.
3. **Given** the application is approved or rejected, **When** the merchant views their status, **Then** they see the outcome and any relevant next-step guidance.

---

### User Story 3 - Review and Approve Applications (Priority: P3)

An internal operations reviewer can evaluate submitted merchant applications, request corrections when information is incomplete, approve or reject applications with a clear decision trail, and ensure approved merchants move into setup, activation, and ongoing monitoring.

**Why this priority**: Merchant onboarding only creates business value if internal teams can process applications, activate eligible merchants, and place them into ongoing compliance oversight.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing a submitted application, recording a decision or request for changes, activating an approved merchant, and verifying the merchant enters ongoing monitoring with the correct visible status updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application has been submitted, **When** an operations reviewer opens it, **Then** they can see all submitted details and supporting materials needed to make a decision.
2. **Given** an application is incomplete or inconsistent, **When** the reviewer requests additional information, **Then** the application status changes accordingly and the merchant is informed that action is required.
3. **Given** an application meets onboarding criteria, **When** the reviewer approves it, **Then** the application proceeds through setup and activation and the merchant enters ongoing monitoring.
4. **Given** an application raises compliance concerns during verification, screening, or risk review, **When** an authorized reviewer evaluates it, **Then** the reviewer can record the compliance outcome and advance, hold, or reject the merchant accordingly.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a merchant starts onboarding but leaves before submitting? The system preserves progress as a draft so the merchant can resume later.
- What happens when the merchant submits duplicate business registrations? The system detects likely duplicates and prevents multiple active applications for the same business without explicit review.
- How does the system handle missing or unreadable supporting materials? The system blocks submission if required materials are missing and flags unreadable materials for correction if discovered during review.
- How does the system handle a merchant whose application is approved after previously being sent back for corrections? The full history of review decisions and merchant updates remains visible.
- What happens when a merchant attempts to read or modify a product belonging to a different merchant? The application MUST reject the request with a 403/404 before reaching the database; RLS MUST additionally block the query at the database layer as a secondary defence.
- What happens when a product image upload to object storage fails? The system MUST reject the product create/update request and return an error; no partial product record is persisted.
- What happens when a product's image URL becomes unreachable after storage deletion? The system MUST return a null image field rather than a broken URL or error.
- What happens when a `PUT /v1/merchants/{id}/location` request supplies an out-of-range latitude (< −90 or > 90) or longitude (< −180 or > 180)? The system MUST reject the request with HTTP 400 and a descriptive validation error; no location record is created or modified.
- What happens when an active merchant later triggers monitoring concerns? The system records the monitoring event, updates the merchant's oversight status, and supports follow-up review actions without losing the original onboarding history.
- What happens when a merchant requests access to or correction of personal data during onboarding? The system supports those requests in line with applicable privacy obligations without breaking the compliance record.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Merchant Application**: A merchant’s onboarding record containing business information, contact details, submission state, status history, and final decision.
- **Business Profile**: The legal and operational identity of the merchant business, including registration, address, and classification details.
- **Person**: An individual associated with the merchant, such as a beneficial owner, director, or other responsible party whose identity or role must be assessed during onboarding.
- **Primary Contact**: The person responsible for submitting and managing the onboarding application on behalf of the merchant.
- **Review Decision**: A recorded internal action on an application, including status change, reviewer rationale, and timestamp.
- **Supporting Material**: Documents or evidence submitted by the merchant to support verification and approval.
- **Risk Assessment**: The record of compliance and business risk evaluation used to support onboarding decisions and downstream monitoring.
- **Monitoring Record**: The post-activation oversight record for an active merchant, including monitoring status, review triggers, outcomes, and follow-up actions.
- **Product**: A catalog item offered by a merchant, carrying a `merchant_id` tenant discriminator, a name, unit price (decimal ≥ 0 in the merchant's registered currency), an `active` flag for soft delete, and an optional image URL referencing object storage. All queries are tenant-scoped by `merchant_id` at both application and database (RLS) layers.
- **MerchantLocation**: An optional entity linked 1-to-1 with a `MerchantApplication`, holding `latitude DECIMAL(9,6)`, `longitude DECIMAL(9,6)`, and an optional `googlePlaceId VARCHAR`. Managed via `PUT /v1/merchants/{merchantId}/location`. Place ID enrichment (address, reviews) is deferred to a future background job.

## Assumptions

- Merchant onboarding is intended for business customers rather than individual consumers.
- A standard review process is required before a merchant becomes active.
- Supporting materials are part of the onboarding process when needed to verify business legitimacy.
- Merchants are allowed to correct and resubmit applications instead of being forced to start over after a review request.
- Merchant notifications can be delivered through the platform’s existing communication channels.
- This feature includes post-activation monitoring at a high level, but detailed monitoring operations may still be decomposed further during planning.
- This feature targets an EU compliance context, so AML/KYB and GDPR obligations are part of the core scope rather than optional add-ons.
